        <h2>Meet the Developer</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            DA-Midst is a high-fidelity prototype developed by a Bachelor of Science 
            (Information Technology [Hons]) degree student majoring in Intelligent Systems 
            from Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM), as the final year project for the A222 semester. 
            The project is non-profit and non-funded. 
            Our goal is to provide a stress and anxiety management system that helps users manage 
            daily pressures through various tools such as mood tracking and stress-relief journaling.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <dl style="margin-left: 20px;">
          <dt style="font-size: 18px;">What is DA-Midst and what does it do?</dt>
          <dd style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            DA-Midst is a web-based platform designed to help university students manage their stress and anxiety. 
            The name DA-Midst is derived from the words Damai, Amidst, and Midst, which convey our mission to help users 
            find inner peace and balance in the midst of their daily challenges.
            Our platform offers various tools to assist users in managing their stress and anxiety, 
            such as mood tracking and stress-relief journaling. It's important to note that DA-Midst is not a diagnostic tool, 
            but rather a screening tool that aims to provide guidance and support to users.
            We believe that mental health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, and we strive to provide a safe 
            and supportive environment for our users to address their mental health needs. DA-Midst is committed to 
            continuously improving and updating our platform to meet the evolving needs of our users</dd>

          <dt style="font-size: 18px;">Is DA-Midst a free or paid service?</dt>
          <dd style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            DA-Midst is completely free to use. We believe that access to mental health resources should be available to everyone, 
            regardless of their financial situation. Our goal is to make stress and anxiety management more accessible to university 
            students, and we hope that by offering our platform for free, we can make a positive impact on their mental health and well-being.</dd>

          <dt style="font-size: 18px;">Does DA-Midst offer any additional features besides mood tracking and journaling?</dt>
          <dd style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            At the moment, DA-Midst is in the prototype stage and only offers mood tracking and journaling features. 
            However, as we continue to gather feedback from users during the testing phase, we will be exploring 
            the possibility of introducing additional features to the platform. We are committed to providing a user-friendly 
            and effective tool to help university students manage their stress and anxiety, and we will continue to work on enhancing 
            the platform based on user needs and feedback.</dd>

          <dt style="font-size: 18px;">Are there any age restrictions or limitations for using DA-Midst?</dt>
          <dd style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            DA-Midst is primarily designed for university students who may be experiencing stress and anxiety. 
            As such, we recommend that users be at least 18 years old to use our service. However, we understand 
            that mental health can affect individuals of all ages, so we do not have any strict age restrictions 
            or limitations for using DA-Midst. We encourage anyone who feels that our service could be beneficial 
            to them to give it a try. We also suggest that users consult with a mental health professional if they 
            have any concerns about their mental wellbeing.</dd>

        <dt style="font-size: 18px;">What can the DA-Midst chatbot (DaDa) do?</dt>
          <dd style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            Currently, the DaDa is able to perform basic communication and tell the time. 
            It also has the ability to suggest some hardcoded music to users. 
            Please note that as our chatbot is still in training, it may not always provide 
            appropriate or optimal responses. Personalized communication is not currently available, 
            but we are continuously working to improve and expand the chatbot's capabilities.</dd>
